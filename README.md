# 🌟 TypeScript: Explicit vs. Implicit Types

TypeScript allows developers to define the types of variables in two primary ways: **Explicit** and **Implicit**. Here's a quick overview:

---

## 📌 Explicit Type

**Explicit** - Writing out the type explicitly:

```typescript
let firstName: string = 'Dylan'
```

- ✅ Easier to read and more intentional.
- ✅ Ensures clarity by defining the expected type upfront.

---

## 📌 Implicit Type

**Implicit** - TypeScript will _infer_ the type based on the assigned value:

```typescript
let firstName = 'Dylan'
```

- 🛠️ **Inference**: TypeScript "guesses" the type of a value during assignment.
- ✅ Shorter and faster to type.
- ✅ Often used during rapid development and testing.

> 💡 **Note:** When TypeScript infers a type, it is referred to as _type inference_.

---

## 🆚 When to Use

- Use **explicit types** when:

  - You want to make the code easier to understand for others (or your future self).
  - You need strict control over types in your application.

- Use **implicit types** when:
  - You're quickly prototyping or testing.
  - The type can be easily inferred without ambiguity.

# 🛠️ TypeScript Types

TypeScript provides a rich set of types to ensure robust and type-safe code. Here's a comprehensive overview:

---

## 🟢 **Primitive Types**

| Type        | Description                         | Example Code                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `string`    | Represents textual data             | `let name: string = 'TypeScript';`             |
| `number`    | Numeric values (integers or floats) | `let age: number = 25;`                        |
| `boolean`   | Logical values `true` or `false`    | `let isActive: boolean = true;`                |
| `null`      | Represents null value               | `let emptyValue: null = null;`                 |
| `undefined` | Uninitialized variable              | `let notAssigned: undefined = undefined;`      |
| `symbol`    | Unique identifiers                  | `let uniqueId: symbol = Symbol('id');`         |
| `bigint`    | Large integers                      | `let largeNumber: bigint = 9007199254740991n;` |

---

## 🟠 **Object Types**

- **Generic Object**: Represents any non-primitive object.  
  Example:

  ```typescript
  let person: object = { name: 'John', age: 30 }
  ```

- **Custom Objects**: Defined using interfaces or type aliases.  
  Example:
  ```typescript
  type Person = { name: string; age: number }
  let person: Person = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 }
  ```

---

## 🔵 **Array and Tuple Types**

- **Array**: Represents a collection of elements.  
  Example:

  ```typescript
  let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3]
  let names: Array<string> = ['Alice', 'Bob']
  ```

- **Tuple**: Fixed-length arrays with specific types.  
  Example:
  ```typescript
  let tuple: [string, number] = ['TypeScript', 2024]
  ```

---

## 🟣 **Function Types**

Specifies the types for parameters and return values.  
Example:

```typescript
let greet: (name: string) => string = (name) => `Hello, ${name}`
```

---

## 🔶 **Union and Intersection Types**

- **Union (`|`)**: A value can be one of several types.  
  Example:

  ```typescript
  let value: string | number = 'TypeScript'
  ```

- **Intersection (`&`)**: Combines multiple types into one.  
  Example:
  ```typescript
  type Admin = { role: string }
  type User = { name: string }
  let adminUser: Admin & User = { role: 'admin', name: 'Alice' }
  ```

---

## 🔷 **Void, Never, and Enum**

- **Void**: For functions that don’t return a value.  
  Example:

  ```typescript
  function logMessage(message: string): void {
    console.log(message)
  }
  ```

- **Never**: For functions that never return (e.g., errors).  
  Example:

  ```typescript
  function throwError(message: string): never {
    throw new Error(message)
  }
  ```

- **Enum**: Defines a set of named constants.  
  Example:
  ```typescript
  enum Direction {
    Up,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right
  }
  let move: Direction = Direction.Up
  ```

---

## 🟡 **Any and Unknown**

- **`any`**: Disables type checking. Use cautiously.  
  Example:

  ```typescript
  let randomValue: any = 42
  ```

- **`unknown`**: A safer alternative to `any` that requires type assertions.  
  Example:
  ```typescript
  let value: unknown = 'hello'
  if (typeof value === 'string') {
    console.log(value.toUpperCase())
  }
  ```

---

## 🔑 **Type Aliases and Interfaces**

- **Type Alias**: A name for a custom type.  
  Example:

  ```typescript
  type Point = { x: number; y: number }
  let point: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 }
  ```

- **Interface**: A contract for object structure.  
  Example:
  ```typescript
  interface Person {
    name: string
    age: number
  }
  let user: Person = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 }
  ```

# ⚙️ TypeScript in `<head>` or `<body>`

When integrating TypeScript into a web application, understanding where to place your scripts is essential for performance and functionality. Here's a breakdown:

---

## 🏷️ **Category: TypeScript Placement**

The placement of TypeScript (compiled to JavaScript) in your HTML impacts how your webpage behaves. Let's explore the options:

---

### 📌 **Scripts in the `<head>`**

Placing scripts in the `<head>` executes them before the page content is rendered.

**Usage Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Pros**:

- ✅ Ensures all scripts are loaded before any content.
- ✅ Useful for critical scripts that must execute before rendering.

**Cons**:

- ❌ May block rendering of the page, leading to slower load times.
- ❌ Can delay the display of visible content (First Paint).

---

### 📌 **Scripts in the `<body>`**

Scripts placed at the end of the `<body>` load after the content is rendered.

**Usage Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>TypeScript Placement</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Pros**:

- ✅ Faster page rendering as the content loads before scripts.
- ✅ Reduces initial load time for visible elements.

**Cons**:

- ❌ Scripts depending on DOM elements must be deferred or wrapped inside an event listener like `DOMContentLoaded`.

---

### 📌 **Defer and Async Attributes**

TypeScript files transpiled to JavaScript can also leverage `defer` and `async` attributes for better control:

#### 🚀 **`defer`**

- Executes the script after the HTML document is fully parsed.
- Retains the order of script execution.

**Example:**

```html
<script src="app.js" defer></script>
```

#### ⚡ **`async`**

- Executes the script as soon as it's downloaded.
- Does not guarantee order of execution.

**Example:**

```html
<script src="app.js" async></script>
```

---

## 🆚 **When to Use Each Placement**

| Placement | Best for                           | Potential Issues               |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `<head>`  | Critical scripts (e.g., analytics) | Slower page rendering          |
| `<body>`  | Non-critical scripts               | May require `DOMContentLoaded` |
| `defer`   | DOM-dependent scripts              | None                           |
| `async`   | Independent scripts                | Execution order not guaranteed |

---

### 💡 **Tips for TypeScript**

- Always compile TypeScript into JavaScript before embedding it in HTML.
- Use modern module loaders (e.g., Webpack, Vite) for better control over script placement and performance.
- For best practices, place scripts at the end of `<body>` or use `defer`.
